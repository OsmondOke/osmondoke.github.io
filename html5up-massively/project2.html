 <br>
 As much as we enjoy the Telecommunication services provided to us, we always want “better”; be it speed, bonus features, </br> 
 <br>add-ons, pricing, etc, and because there are many other companies providing the same services, what would </br> 
 <br> make a customer stay with their service provider, and not drive them to cancel their subscriptions, and leave </br>
 <br> for their subjective better (Churn)? This is where the problem arises. In this project, my aim was to understand </br>
 <br> the patterns in the customers that churned, in order to make accurate predictions about what users would be most </br>
 <br> likely to churn, and in turn try to prevent it when possible. </br>
