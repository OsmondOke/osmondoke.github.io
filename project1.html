    <p>The aim of this project was to take the factors we have been presented with, and determine how these factors play a part in <br>
    </br>the contribution to heart disease. With these findings, we will be able to make predictions about <br>
    </br>early detection, and even possible prevention of heart diseases in patients. The jupyter notebook and the findings can be seen below.
